		<p>To kick off your new year at Ada, the Student Voice invites you to participate in an exciting group cybersecurity competition: <strong>Capture the Flag (CTF)</strong>!</p>
		<p>In this challenge, youâ€™ll work in teams to uncover hidden strings, known as "flags," within this website. Collaborate with your classmates and Year 13s to find as many flags as possible. The team that discovers the most flags will win a prize!</p>
		<p>Flags are in the format of flag{random_string} and when you have found one you can upload it to the website from the submit flag button in the footer</p>
		<p>Hints can be found on the footer of the main page (no limit to accessing hints)</p>
